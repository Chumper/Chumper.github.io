I always wanted to blog about my coding experience but ever since i found it hard to set up and maintain a blog.
In the earlier days that meant to install a blogging application on your own webspace with a database in the background.
I started the first try with WordPress but found it hard to continue to blog.

This days I set up a new blog with `Jekyll`, `AsciiDoc(tor)` and `PlantUML` hosted on `github-pages`.
Here is what I did to create a functional blog baked by `travis.ci`.
